    // THE VERSION NUMBER FOR YOUR FORM IS NOT RELATED TO THE OPENCRVS VERSION.
    // THIS IS A VERSION NUMBER FOR YOUR USE AS YOU EDIT FORMS OVER TIME.

    // AFTER YOU HAVE STARTED REGISTERING CITIZENS, WHEN YOU MAKE A CHANGE TO A FORM IN PRODUCTION,
    // THE FORM MAY NO LONGER WORK FOR REGISTRATIONS MADE ON A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE FORM.

    // THIS IS BECAUSE, YOU MAY HAVE REMOVED PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED QUESTIONS, OR ADDED NEW ONES.

    // AN OLDER REGISTRATION MAY NOT HAVE CAPTURED SUCH DATA, SO IF YOU VIEW OR CORRECT THAT RECORD
    // YOU MAY FIND THAT REQUIRED DATA IS NOW MISSING AND FORM VALIDATION PREVENTS THE SUBMISSION OF THE FORM.

    // WE HAVE A BACKLOG ITEM TO ALLOW REGISTRATION FORM CHANGES TO BE MADE POST LIVE TO
    // SUPPORT CIVIL REGISTRATION REGULATORY CHANGES THAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

    // FOLLOW THE STATUS OF THIS ISSUE: https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/3798

    // IN THE MEANTIME, WHENEVER YOU SEMANTICALLY INCREMENT THE VERSION NUMBER BELOW, WE WILL SAVE A VERSION OF YOUR FORM IN AN IMMUTABLE DATABASE.

    // THIS WILL ALLOW US IN FUTURE TO ASSOCIATE A REGISTRATION WITH A PREVIOUSLY DRAFTED REGISTRATION FORM
    // EVEN IF THE CIVIL REGISTRATION REGULATIONS EVOLVE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
