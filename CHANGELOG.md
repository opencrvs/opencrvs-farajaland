### Breaking changes

### New features

- #### Greater customizability of location data in certificates

  The various admin level handlebars e.g. **statePlaceofbirth**,
  **districtPrimaryMother** only contained the name of that location which was
  not able to take advantage of all the information OpenCRVS had available
  about the various admin levels e.g. the name of that location in the
  secondary language. So we are introducing a new set of admin level
  handlebars that would contain the **id** of that location which we can
  resolve into a value of the shape

  ```
  {
    name: string
    alias: string
  }
  ```

  using the new **"location"** handlebar helper. Here name is the primary
  label of the location and alias being the secondary one. Currently only
  these 2 fields are available but we will be adding more fields depending on
  various countries requirements. If previously the certificate svg used to
  contain `{{districtPlaceofbirth}}` then now we can replace it with
  `{{location districtPlaceofbirthId 'name'}}`. To access alias, the `'name'`
  needs to be replaced with `'alias'`.

  Below is a list of all the new handlebars that are meant to be used with the
  "location" handlebar helper.

  - statePrimaryInformantId
  - districtPrimaryInformantId
  - statePlaceofbirthId
  - districtPlaceofbirthId
  - statePrimaryMotherId
  - districtPrimaryMotherId
  - statePrimaryFatherId
  - districtPrimaryFatherId
  - statePrimaryDeceasedId
  - districtPrimaryDeceasedId
  - statePlaceofdeathId
  - districtPlaceofdeathId
  - statePrimaryGroomId
  - districtPrimaryGroomId
  - statePrimaryBrideId
  - districtPrimaryBrideId
  - statePlaceofmarriageId
  - districtPlaceofmarriageId
  - registrar.stateId
  - registrar.districtId
  - registrar.officeId
  - registrationAgent.stateId
  - registrationAgent.districtId
  - registrationAgent.officeId

  ##### We will be deprecating the counterpart of the above mentioned handlebars that contains only the label of the specified location in a future version so we highly recommend that implementers update their certificates to use these new ones.
