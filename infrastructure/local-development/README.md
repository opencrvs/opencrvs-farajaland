# Developing Ansible playbooks & other infrastructure locally

In this directory, you will find all tooling, setup and guidance needed for developing OpenCRVS locally. This means you can iterate on Ansible playbooks without having to run slow Github pipelines again and again.

Currently, the setup only supports MacOS. For more instructions, start by opening the [provision.ipynb](./provision.ipynb) playbook.
